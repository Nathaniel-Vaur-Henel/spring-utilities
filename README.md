# Spring Utilities

> Write Once, Use Anywhere.    
> So, We write Once, You use Anywhere.

This library contains some convenient utils to easily automatize frequently task in Spring.

## Presentation

From one project to another, some tasks keep coming back.
It is these kinds of tasks that we want to facilitate here.

In [libraries](libraries) directory, you will find code to import into your project.
